-Changed the naming scheme from the version name to 'main.py' as I required another file for the menu system and the 'vx.y' naming system
 meant I could not call the main file from the menu.

22/12/21:
-Going to make the animation after the simulation instead of in real-time with the calculations, as this is the only way Celluloid works.

24/12/21:
-Decided to change the tickrate to something faster soon, as 2 every second produces a very small number of data points.

27/12/21
-Going to plot a line instead of points.
-Changed animation.py into graphics.py and decided to use it for the final graphs too.

22/02/22
-Changed preset numbers as calculations were incorrect
-Football area: 0.38m^2 -> 0.038m^2
-Basketball area: 0.044m^2 -> 0.048m^2
