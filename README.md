This is the codebase for my A Level EPQ. I used Python to create a simulation of projectile motion, using the Euler numerical method.

📁misc: various practice programs and tests that I performed throughout development, as I was learning several new libraries at once.

📁Simulations: graphical outputs of four simulation runs that I used to evaluate my project in an accompanying report.

📁v1.x: the first iteration of the program, where I wrote the numerical algorithms.

📁v2.x: the second iteration, where I added a main menu in tkinter, used to control the initial parameters of the simulation.

📁v3.x: the third iteration, where I wrote the animation code using Celluloid.

📁v4.x: the fourth and final iteration, where I added post-simulation graphing parameters.

📄changes during process: a short document overviewing where I had to change fundamental parts of the program.

📄log: the full development log, detailing what I did at every stage.

📄sources for presets: a note of where I found numbers for the planet/projectile presets.
